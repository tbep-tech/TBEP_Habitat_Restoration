This is the approved method that FWC uses in most of their freshwater lake SAV plantings. These were evenly distributed in the targeted area.","Taylor Lake located in Pinellas County formerly had both native and nonnative SAV covering the bottom of the lake; however in early 2025 the dam had to be replaced so the lake was drained for several months which killed all of the SAV.

The mosquito ditches were either filled with the excavated spoil material to black mangrove elevations, dredged to promote effective diurnal flushing, or desilted to remove organics. Ditch blocks were installed at the end of ditches that were filled to prevent the movement of the placed fill material into the dredged or desilted ditches.  Nuisance species were removed from a few isolated spoil mounds with difficult access and planted with native upland species. Additional areas that exhibited saltern conditions were planted with appropriate species. This project will encourage the recruitment of mangroves, restore tidal flows, and improve fisheries habitat.","The restoration site at Weedon Island Preserve consisted of mosquito ditches and spoil mounds among a black mangrove habitat.  While the mosquito ditching created some red mangrove habitat, most ditches exhibited poor water quality from limited flushing.  The impounded ditches captured organics up to two feet deep which caused anoxic conditions.
