This was a unique project partnering a homeowners association with a school to improve water quality in 3 of their ponds before draining to Tampa Bay.  In Florida, homeowner associations are very particular about the aesthetics of their property and usually are not willing to participate in projects where they may have to relinquish some control of an area in their property.
