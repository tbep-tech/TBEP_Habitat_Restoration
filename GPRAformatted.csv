Most of the vegetation was chipped up, except for the largest oak trees and some palms which were set aside for re-use. Some of the fill was used to fill small sections of the mosquito ditch but the majority of the ditch as well as the mangroves along the ditch bank were not altered during restoration. The excess dirt was hauled off site and the disturbed areas of the site where the mosquito mounds were located (50 ft wide on each side of the ditch) were graded to a uniform elevation of +/- 2 feet amsl. This allows the entire site to be flooded during normal high tides. A 4:1 slope was created along the northern side of the site for the transition between wetlands and adjacent uplands. The large oak trees and palm trees removed earlier were placed back on the site (dead) to act as ‘structure’ or snags for additional habitat value. The western end of the mosquito ditch (outfall location of the ditch) was plugged to eliminate the potential for short-circuiting overland flow of freshwater (stormwater) during low tide conditions. Upon completion of site grading, the site was planted with 13,000 bare root marsh grass plants to help stabilize the sediment and create a marsh habitat.
