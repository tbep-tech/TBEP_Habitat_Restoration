Following the initial herbicide applications, contractors were responsible to retreat invasive plant species within the project area until the plants were completely dead.  No further removal or treatment was required after the invasive species were killed, and plants were left to breakdown over time.  In addition, mechanical clearing of Brazilian pepper was accomplished on a 30 acre site which included an area of gopher tortoise habitat in the south central portion of the base.

R-164,Se7en Wetlands Upland Restoration (North Field),2021,The property under the name 'Se7en Wetlands' has multiple habitats including upland areas. This 'north field' site was once part of a phosphate mine that *could* have been restored at some point in time- although the City acquired this land before mandatory restoration laws went into effect in Florida. It is an area accessible to the public via hiking trail. ,"The first step was to identify the plants growing in this field. Most of them were invasive species, with a few natives mixed throughout the project area. Herbicide was used in October 2020 to combat the invasive grasses like cogon grass. The site was burned to remove thatch buildup in March 2021. The City of Lakeland hired The Natives, Inc. to contract grown and install 16,800 native wildflowers and grasses in August 2021.
