# TBEP_Habitat_Restoration

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is required to conform to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). Data for habitat restoration are submitted each year through the National Estuary Program Online Reporting Tool (GPRA/NEPORT), as reported by the Tampa Bay Estuary Program. This dataset is a comprehensive list of restoration projects in Tampa Bay and its watershed from 1971 to present as reported through GPRA/NEPORT. The dataset includes information on the project name, date, location, restoration activity, habitat type, partner responsible for the project, and approximate coverage. The dataset is updated annually.

The archived dataset is available on KNB at: <https://doi.org/10.5063/F1TD9VTJ>
